  length metadata were very large, as might occur if a pool contained very
  many devices:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/pull/1521

- Clarify the error message that stratisd displays if an external application
  that it depends on is missing:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/pull/1547

- Use nested imports in all Rust source:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/pull/1517

- Metadata refactoring to improve encapsulation and clarity and to use
  types to distinguish among the sizes of different metadata regions:

  status parsing code, and handle the newly available values appropriately:
  https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/pull/1461

- Set RUST_BACKTRACE to 1 in the systemd service file in order to ensure that
  a stack trace is generated if stratisd panics:
