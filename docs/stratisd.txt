NAME
----
stratisd - Daemon to create and monitor storage pools

SYNOPSIS
--------
  stratisd [GLOBAL OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*stratisd* is a daemon that creates, manages, and monitors local storage
pools. It is controlled by the user with the *stratis* command-line tool, or
via its D-Bus interface.

Stratisd manages *pools* created from one or more block devices (*blockdevs*),
and then enables multiple *filesystems* to be created from the pool.

Typically, Stratisd is not invoked by the user, but runs as a system service.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------
--debug::
	Output additional diagnostic information when running.
--sim::
	Run with a simulated engine that does not actually perform storage
	configuration, instead of the default engine.
--help, -h::
	Show help.
