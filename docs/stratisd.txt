NAME
----
stratisd - Daemon to create and monitor storage pools

SYNOPSIS
--------
  stratisd [GLOBAL OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*stratisd* creates, manages, and monitors local storage pools. It is
controlled by the user with the *stratis* command-line tool, or using D-Bus.

Stratis *pools* created from one or more block devices (*blockdevs*),
and then enables multiple *filesystems* to be created from the pool.

Typically, Stratisd is not invoked by the user, but runs as a system service.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------
--sim::
	Run with a simulated engine that does not actually perform storage
	configuration, instead of the default engine.
--log-level::
        Specify the log level for log messages. Only messages with severity
        at or above the level specified will be emitted. If this option is
        omitted, stratisd respects the RUST_LOG environment variable.
        Otherwise, stratisd uses the default log level, which is error.
--help, -h::
	Show help.
