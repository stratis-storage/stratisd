//! Discover or identify devices that may belong to Stratis.
//!
//! This module contains methods for finding all block devices that may belong
//! to Stratis, generally run when Stratis starts up, and other methods that
//! may be used to classify a single unknown block device.
//!
//! The methods rely to a greater or lesser extent on libudev.
//!
//! They have the following invocation heirarchy:
//! find_all*
//!  |
//! find_all_*_devices
//!  |
//! identify_*_device
//!  |
//! process_*_device
//!
//! The primary purpose of the find* methods is to construct a udev
//! enumeration and to properly process each of the udev database entries
//! found.
//!
//! The primary purpose of the identify_* methods is to use udev to identify
//! a single device and take the appropriate action based on that
//! identification.
//!
//! The primary purpose of the process_* methods is to gather up Stratis
//! device identifiers.
//!
//! Each method is expected to be invoked in a particular situation which
//! is guaranteed by the method that invokes it. The methods are not,
//! in general, general purpose methods that can be used in any situation.
//!
//! find_all is public because it is the method that is invoked by the
//! engine on startup. find_all_block_devices_with_stratis_signatures is
//! public for use in testing. identify_block_device is public because it
//! is suitable for identifying a block device associated with a uevent,
//! as the situation in which the uevent is handled is equivalent to that
//! provided by the execution of the
//! find_all_block_devices_with_stratis_signatures method.
