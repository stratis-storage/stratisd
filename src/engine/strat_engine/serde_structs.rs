// Our current on-disk metadata format uses a JSON-based structure. We
// are using serde-rs, which allows us to implement serialization (to
// JSON) and deserialization (from JSON) by deriving Serialize and
// Deserialize traits.  But, our in-memory structs are too complex for
// serde to handle, and in any case it's best to not tie our real
// structs to what will be saved on disk. Therefore we have *Save
// structs. These contain simple, serde-friendly data types, and we
// can convert to or from them when saving our current state, or
// restoring state from saved metadata.
